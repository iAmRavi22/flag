            <h4>Privacy Policy</h4>
            <p>We take your privacy seriously and will take all measures to protect your personal information. Accordingly, we have developed this Policy to understand how we collect, use, communicate, and disclose and make use of personal information. Any personal information received will only be used to fill your order. We will not sell or redistribute your information to anyone. We are committed to conducting our business according to these principles to ensure that the confidentiality of personal information is protected and maintained.</p>
        <h4>Basics</h4>
        <p>Before or at the time of collecting personal information,
             we will identify the purposes for which information is being collected. 
             We will only collect and use personal information for those purposes specified by us,
              and for other compatible purposes, unless we obtain the consent of the individual 
              concerned or as required by law. We will only retain personal information for as long 
              as necessary to fulfil those purposes. We will collect personal information by lawful 
              and fair means and, where appropriate, with the knowledge or consent of the individual 
              concerned. Personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which it is to be used,
               and, to the extent necessary for those purposes, should be accurate, complete, 
               and up-to-date.
        We will protect personal information by reasonable security safeguards against loss or theft
       and unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification. We will make readily 
       available to customers information about our policies and practices relating to personal 
        information management. Some payments are processed using PayPalâ€™s secure system while others
       are processed using a secure payment gateway, with no sensitive financial information being 
       input through our web site. The secure method of accepting payments is processed using SSL 
       encryption. We may collect and store limited payment information from you, such as payment card 
       type and expiration date and the last four digits of your payment card number; however, 
       we do not collect or store full payment card numbers. Our third-party payment processor 
      processes all transactions.
    </p>
             <h4>Use of Information</h4>
             <p>We use other companies, agents, or contractors ("Service Providers") to perform 
                services on our behalf or assist us with providing services to you. For example,
                 we engage Service Providers to provide marketing, advertising, communications, 
                 infrastructure, and IT services, to personalize and optimize our service, 
                 to process credit card transactions or other payment methods, to provide 
                 customer service, to collect debts, to analyse and enhance data, and to process 
                 and administer consumer surveys. In the course of providing such services, 
                 these Service Providers may have access to your personal or other information. 
                 We only authorize them to use or disclose your personal information in connection
                  with providing their services.</p>
